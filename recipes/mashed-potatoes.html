    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>These mashed potatoes are too fattening to have on a regular basis. I only make these on holidays, and everyone wonders what's in them that's makes them so rich...</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>5 pounds red potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>Â½ cup butter</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes in a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until fork tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, add butter, and mash using a potato masher, ricer or mixer. Gradually beat in the heavy cream. Serve hot!</li>
    </ol>
